# Title: Orby's Asteroid Adventure

Description: This was the first game I ever worked on, made in a group of 4 in which I was the project lead. I made the graphics (the monster, the dog, and asteroid background, etc.) and did most of the coding in the project. I used HTML and the Phaser editor to work on the game, and this was the project that sparked my interest in game development and software engineering. This was made in 2022 when I attended the University of Texas Computer Science Academy for Women: Game Development edition.

The hardest part about this project as far as I remember was making it look like it was an endless runner. I had a tough time coding the camera movement to follow the dog and the repetition of the background.  In the future I would make the box around the monsters smaller so that it wouldn't be so easy to lose, and I would fix the Game Over words to align in the middle of the camera's location. This was a difficult project to complete due to the 4 day time constraint but overall this was a very fun project!
